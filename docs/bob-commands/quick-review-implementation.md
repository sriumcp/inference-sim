# Quick-Review Implementation Guide

**Status:** Active (v1.0 — created 2026-03-19)

This document provides implementation details for the `/quick-review` Bob command, including perspective mappings, execution algorithms, and usage examples.

---

## Overview

The `/quick-review` command provides multi-perspective code reviews using the same 43 perspective prompts from the convergence-review skill, but with sequential execution (no parallel agents) and no convergence loop. This bridges the gap between the general `/review` command and the formal `/convergence-review` skill.

**Key differences from other review commands:**

| Feature | `/review` | `/quick-review` | `/convergence-review` |
|---------|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| Tool | Bob command | Bob command | Claude Code skill |
| Perspectives | 4 general | 5-10 domain-specific | 5-10 domain-specific |
| Execution | Single session | Single session | Parallel agents |
| Loop | No | No | Yes (Phase A/B) |
| Output | Bob Findings | Bob Findings | Conversation + state file |
| Token cost | Low | Medium | High |
| Defaults | No | Yes | No |
| Aliases | No | Yes | No |
| Fuzzy matching | No | Yes | No |
| Use case | General review | Domain spot-check | Formal gate |

---

## Bob Command Format

The command is defined in `.bob/commands/quick-review.md` with two main sections:

### Frontmatter (YAML)

```yaml
---
description: Execute multi-perspective review using convergence-review perspectives (sequential, no loop)
argument-hint: <gate-type> [artifact-path]
---
```

**Fields:**
- `description`: Brief description shown in Bob's command menu
- `argument-hint`: Shows expected arguments (displayed in gray in command menu)

### Command Prompt

The command prompt contains instructions for Bob to execute the workflow:
1. Parse arguments (`$1` for gate-type, `$2` for artifact-path)
2. Normalize gate type (aliases + fuzzy matching)
3. Load artifact (with default search if path not provided)
4. Read perspective prompts from `.claude/skills/convergence-review/*.md` files
5. Execute each perspective sequentially
6. Extract and accumulate findings
7. Report via `submit_review_findings`
8. Exit (no Phase B, no state file)

# Review hypothesis code (5 perspectives)
/quick-review h-code hypotheses/h-reasoning-kv/
```

### Fuzzy Matching Examples

```bash
# High similarity (>70%) - suggests match
/quick-review discovry
# Output: Did you mean 'h-findings'? Valid gates: pr-plan, pr-code, design, macro-plan, h-design, h-code, h-findings. Aliases: plan, code, implementation, findings, discovery

# High similarity (>70%) - suggests match
/quick-review macro
# Output: Did you mean 'macro-plan'? Valid gates: pr-plan, pr-code, design, macro-plan, h-design, h-code, h-findings. Aliases: plan, code, implementation, findings, discovery

# Low similarity (≤70%) - shows error
/quick-review xyz
# Output: Invalid gate type 'xyz'. Valid gates: pr-plan, pr-code, design, macro-plan, h-design, h-code, h-findings. Aliases: plan, code, implementation, findings, discovery
```

### Error Cases

```bash
# Empty diff
/quick-review pr-code
# Output: No changes detected since last commit. Nothing to review.
#         Suggestion: Stage new files or commit changes before invoking.

# Missing file
/quick-review pr-plan nonexistent.md
# Output: File not found: nonexistent.md
#         Searched: docs/plans/
#         Suggestion: Provide explicit path as second argument

# Default search failed
/quick-review design
# Output: No matching files found for pattern: docs/plans/*-design.md
#         Searched in: docs/plans/
#         Suggestion: Provide explicit path as second argument
```

## Comparison with Other Review Commands

### When to Use Each Command

**Use `/review`** when:
- You need a quick general review (4 perspectives)
- You want basic bug/security scanning
- You don't need domain-specific expertise
- Token cost is a primary concern

**Use `/quick-review`** when:
- You want domain-specific review quality (5-10 perspectives)
- You're doing iterative development and need spot-checks
- You want convergence-review quality without the convergence loop
- You can tolerate medium token cost for better quality

**Use `/convergence-review`** (Claude Code) when:
- You're at a formal gate (Step 2.5 or 4.5 in PR workflow)
- You need guaranteed convergence (0 CRITICAL + 0 IMPORTANT)
- You want automatic fix-and-rerun loop
- Token cost is not a concern
- You're using Claude Code (not Bob)

---

## Implementation Notes

### Token Cost Analysis

**Parallel dispatch (convergence-review):**
- N perspectives × full context per perspective
- Example: 10 perspectives × 10K tokens = 100K tokens per round

**Sequential execution (quick-review):**
- Shared context + N perspective prompts
- Example: 10K tokens (context) + 10 × 1K tokens (prompts) = 20K tokens
- **Savings: ~80% compared to parallel dispatch**

Note: Actual savings depend on context size and perspective complexity. The shared context reduces per-perspective overhead.

### Fuzzy Matching Implementation

Use Levenshtein distance normalized to 0-100% similarity:

```python
def levenshtein_similarity(s1, s2):
    distance = levenshtein_distance(s1, s2)
    max_len = max(len(s1), len(s2))
    return 100 * (1 - distance / max_len)
```

Threshold of 70% provides good balance between helpfulness and precision.

### Prompt Extraction

Extract prompts from markdown code blocks:

```python
def extract_prompts(file_content):
    prompts = []
    in_block = False
    current = []
    
    for line in file_content.split('\n'):
        if line.strip() == '```':
            if in_block:
                prompts.append('\n'.join(current))
                current = []
            in_block = not in_block
        elif in_block:
            current.append(line)
    
    return prompts
```

## Maintenance

### Adding New Perspectives

To add a new perspective to an existing gate:

1. Add the perspective prompt to the appropriate source file (`.claude/skills/convergence-review/*.md`)
2. Update the perspective count in this document
3. No changes needed to the Bob command file (it reads prompts dynamically)

### Adding New Gate Types

To add a new gate type:

1. Add perspective prompts to appropriate source file
2. Update the Bob command file (`.bob/commands/quick-review.md`):
   - Add to canonical names list
   - Add to gate type table
   - Add artifact loading logic
   - Add to source map
3. Update this implementation guide:
   - Add to gate types table
   - Add to perspective sources section
   - Add usage examples

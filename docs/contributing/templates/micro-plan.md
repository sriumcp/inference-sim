# Micro Plan Template (Single-PR Implementation Plan)

This template defines the output format for a single-PR implementation plan. Use this when planning any PR — from bug fixes to new features.

!!! note "For Claude Code users"
    The `writing-plans` skill generates plans from this template automatically.
    The agent prompt version is at [`micro-plan-prompt.md`](micro-plan-prompt.md).

The source of work may be a macro plan section, one or more GitHub issues, a design document, or a feature request.

The plan has **two audiences:**

1. A human reviewer who validates behavioral correctness (Part 1)
2. An implementer (human or agent) who executes the tasks (Part 2)

---

## Compact Format (Small Tier PRs)

For Small tier PRs (see [PR Size Tiers](../pr-workflow.md#pr-size-tiers)), use this streamlined format instead of the full template below. The compact format retains behavioral rigor (contracts + TDD) while dropping sections that add no value for mechanical changes.

**Criteria — use compact format when ALL of these apply:**

- Docs-only with no process/workflow semantic changes (typo fixes, formatting, comment updates, link fixes), OR
- ≤3 files changed AND only mechanical changes (renames, formatting) AND no behavioral logic changes AND no new interfaces/types AND no new CLI flags

!!! note "Process/workflow semantic changes"
    Changing how the PR workflow operates, adding new template sections, or modifying review criteria are semantic changes — use the full format even if the PR is docs-only.

**Compact plan structure:**

````
# [Title] Implementation Plan

**Goal:** One sentence a non-contributor could understand.
**Source:** Link to source of work.
**Closes:** GitHub issue numbers (e.g., `Fixes #123`).

## Behavioral Contracts

BC-1: <Name>
- GIVEN <precondition>
- WHEN <action>
- THEN <observable outcome>

[Repeat for each contract. Quality gate: every THEN clause must describe
observable behavior, not internal structure.]

## Tasks

### Task 1: <Name> (BC-1)

**Files:** create/modify `path/to/file`, test `path/to/test`

**Test:**
[Complete test code]

**Impl:**
[Complete implementation code]

**Verify:** `go test ./path/... -run TestName`
**Lint:** `golangci-lint run ./path/...`
**Commit:** `type(scope): description (BC-1)`

[Repeat for each task.]

## Sanity Checklist

[Same checklist as full format — antipattern rules still apply.]
````

**Sections omitted or streamlined in compact format** (compared to full template):

- Document Header — streamlined to Goal/Source/Closes (drops: The problem today, What this PR adds, Why this matters, Architecture, Behavioral Contracts reference)
- Phase 0: Component Context
- Part 1 Section A: Executive Summary
- Part 1 Section C: Component Interaction
- Part 1 Section D: Deviation Log
- Part 1 Section E: Review Guide
- Part 2 Section F: Implementation Overview
- Part 2 Section H: Test Strategy
- Part 2 Section I: Risk Analysis
- Appendix: File-Level Implementation Details

**What's kept and why:**

- **Behavioral contracts** — the substance of what the PR guarantees (non-negotiable)
- **TDD tasks** — executable implementation steps (non-negotiable)
- **Sanity checklist** — quality gate (catches antipatterns regardless of PR size)

---

## Document Header

Every plan starts with this header:

- **Goal:** One sentence a non-contributor could understand — what capability does this PR add?
- **The problem today:** 2–3 sentences explaining what's missing or broken without this PR.
- **What this PR adds:** Numbered list of 2–4 concrete capabilities, each in plain language with a brief example.
- **Why this matters:** 1–2 sentences connecting this PR to the broader project vision.
- **Architecture:** 2–3 sentences about the technical approach (packages, key types, integration points).
- **Source:** Link to the source of work (macro plan section, issue numbers, design doc).
- **Closes:** GitHub issue numbers this PR will close on merge (e.g., `Fixes #183, fixes #189`).
- **Behavioral Contracts:** Reference to Part 1, Section B.

## Phase 0: Component Context (before writing the plan)

Before writing the plan, identify this PR's place in the system:

1. Which building block is being added or modified?
2. What are the adjacent blocks it interacts with?
3. What invariants does this PR touch?
4. **Construction Site Audit:** For every struct this PR adds fields to, grep for ALL places that struct is constructed. List each site. If there are multiple construction sites, the plan must either add a canonical constructor or update every site explicitly.

---

## Part 1: Design Validation (target <120 lines)

### A) Executive Summary

5–10 lines describing what this PR builds (plain language), where it fits in the system, adjacent components it interacts with, and any deviation flags.

### B) Behavioral Contracts

3–15 named contracts defining what this PR guarantees:

```
BC-N: <Name>
- GIVEN <precondition>
- WHEN <action>
- THEN <observable outcome>
- MECHANISM: <one sentence explaining how> (optional)
```

Group into: positive contracts (what MUST happen), negative contracts (what MUST NOT happen), error handling contracts.

**Quality gate:** Every THEN clause must describe **observable behavior**, not internal structure. If a THEN clause contains a concrete type name or internal field name, rewrite it. The THEN clause drives the test assertion — a structural THEN produces a structural test.

### C) Component Interaction

Text-based component diagram showing this PR's building block, adjacent components, data flow direction, and what crosses each boundary. Include API contracts and state ownership. Target: under 40 lines.

### D) Deviation Log

Table comparing the micro plan against the source document:

| Source Says | Micro Plan Does | Reason |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| ... | ... | CLARIFICATION / SIMPLIFICATION / CORRECTION / DEFERRAL / ADDITION / SCOPE_CHANGE |

### E) Review Guide

5–10 lines telling the reviewer: the tricky part, what to scrutinize, what's safe to skim, and known debt.

---

## Part 2: Executable Implementation

### F) Implementation Overview

Files to create/modify (one-line each), key decisions, confirmation that no dead code exists.

### G) Task Breakdown (6–12 tasks)

Each task follows TDD format:

1. Write failing test
2. Run test to verify it fails
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Run test to verify it passes
5. Run lint check
6. Commit with contract reference

Each task must specify: contracts implemented (BC-X, BC-Y), files (create/modify/test), complete code in every step, exact commands with expected output.

**Task design rules:** Each task implements 1–3 related contracts. Complete code in every step (no "add validation" without showing exact code). Exact commands with expected output. Reference shared test infrastructure. Golden dataset updates if needed. Dependency ordering. No dead code. Behavioral assertions only (see [standards/principles.md](../standards/principles.md) for prohibited/required assertion patterns).

### H) Test Strategy

Map contracts to tasks and tests. Include invariant tests alongside golden tests — golden tests answer "did the output change?" while invariant tests answer "is the output correct?"

| Contract | Task | Test Type | Test Name |
|----------|------|-----------|-----------|
| BC-1 | Task 1 | Unit | TestFoo_GivenX_ThenY |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

Key invariants for this simulator (see [standards/invariants.md](../standards/invariants.md)):

- **Request conservation (INV-1):** completed + still_queued + still_running + dropped_unservable + timed_out = injected (cluster runs add gateway/routing/encode buckets — see canonical INV-1)
- **KV block conservation (INV-4):** allocated_blocks + free_blocks = total_blocks
- **Clock monotonicity (INV-3):** simulation clock never decreases
- **Causality (INV-5):** arrival_time ≤ enqueue_time ≤ schedule_time ≤ completion_time
- **Determinism (INV-6):** same seed produces byte-identical output across runs

### I) Risk Analysis

For each risk: description, likelihood (low/medium/high), impact (low/medium/high), mitigation (specific test or design choice), and which task mitigates it.

## Part 3: Quality Assurance

### J) Sanity Checklist

Before implementation, verify:

**Plan-specific checks:**
- [ ] No unnecessary abstractions.
- [ ] No feature creep beyond PR scope.
- [ ] No unexercised flags or interfaces.
- [ ] No partial implementations.

- [ ] Construction site audit completed — all struct construction sites listed and covered by tasks.
- [ ] If this PR is part of a macro plan, the macro plan status is updated.

**Antipattern rules (full details in [standards/rules.md](../standards/rules.md)):**
- [ ] R1: No silent `continue`/`return` dropping data
- [ ] R2: Map keys sorted before float accumulation or ordered output

- **Complete implementation:** All type definitions, function implementations, test code
- **Key implementation notes:**
    - **Event ordering:** Priority? Timestamp? Secondary tie-breaking?
    - **RNG usage:** Which subsystem from PartitionedRNG?
    - **Metrics:** What metrics are collected? Where aggregated?
    - **State mutation:** What gets modified? Who owns it?
    - **Error handling:** Panic, return error, or log-and-continue?

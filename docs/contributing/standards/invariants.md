# BLIS System Invariants

Invariants are properties that must hold at all times during and after simulation. They are verified by invariant tests (see R7) and checked during self-audit (Step 4.75).

**Hypothesis family mapping:** INV-1 through INV-3, INV-5, and INV-6 belong to the **Scheduler invariants (safety/liveness)** family. INV-4 (KV cache conservation), INV-7 (signal freshness), INV-8 (work-conserving property), and INV-9 (oracle knowledge boundary) belong to the **Structural model** family. See `docs/contributing/standards/experiments.md` for hypothesis family definitions.

## INV-1: Request Conservation

**Statement:** `injected_requests == completed_requests + still_queued + still_running + dropped_unservable` at simulation end (all levels).

**Full pipeline:** `num_requests == injected_requests + rejected_requests` (from anomaly counters).

**Verification:** `sim/cluster/cluster_test.go` — conservation tests. Conservation fields (`still_queued`, `still_running`, `injected_requests`) are included in CLI JSON output.

**Evidence:** Issue #183 — a silently-dropped request violated conservation for months.

**Experimental validation:** H12 confirmed conservation across 10 policy configurations (67 invariant checks) — including round-robin, least-loaded, weighted (multiple scorer configs), SJF, priority-FCFS, token-bucket admission, and always-busiest. H8 confirmed conservation under extreme KV pressure (15 configurations). Full preemption-path validation is blocked by the panic bug (#293).

**Additional evidence (hardening wave):** Issue #498, fix #504 — `InjectArrival` silently accepted requests with `ArrivalTime > Horizon`, registering them in `Metrics.Requests` but never firing the arrival event. This broke conservation accounting (LHS included the request, RHS never completed it). Fix: log warning on beyond-horizon injection.

## INV-2: Request Lifecycle

**Statement:** Requests transition `queued -> running -> completed`. No invalid transitions. Requests not completed before horizon remain in current state.

**Verification:** State machine assertions in request processing code.

---

## INV-3: Clock Monotonicity

**Statement:** Simulation clock never decreases. Every event's timestamp >= the previous event's timestamp.

**Verification:** Clock is advanced in the event loop only via min-heap extraction, which guarantees non-decreasing order.

---

## INV-4: KV Cache Conservation

**Statement:** `allocated_blocks + free_blocks = total_blocks` at all times.

**Verification:** Checked after every allocation/deallocation. Transactional allocation with rollback on mid-loop failure (R5).

**Operational note (H8):** KV cache pressure exhibits a sharp cliff, not gradual degradation. In H8's workload, performance was identical above ~2200 blocks and collapsed below it (4.7x TTFT P99 increase with just 4.5% fewer blocks). Below ~1000 blocks, the preempt-requeue cycle can livelock (see R19). Capacity planning formula: `threshold ≈ rate / num_instances × (input_tokens + output_tokens) / block_size`.

**Additional evidence (hardening wave):** Two KV conservation bugs discovered in March 2026: (1) Issue #492, fix #502 — prefill capacity pre-check over-estimated by up to 1 block (partial last-block fill not accounted for), causing false allocation failures that triggered unnecessary preemptions. (2) Issue #501, fix #506 — TieredKVCache CPU→GPU reload could produce an inverted range (`newStart >= endIndex`), causing a slice-bounds panic in block allocation. Both bugs directly affected the allocation/deallocation balance that INV-4 protects. (See also #519 in INV-8 — the range-loop livelock primarily violated the work-conserving property, not block-level conservation.)

---

## INV-5: Causality

**Statement:** `arrival_time <= enqueue_time <= schedule_time <= completion_time` for every request.

**Verification:** Per-request metric timestamps recorded at each lifecycle stage. Invariant tests verify ordering for all completed requests.

---

## INV-6: Determinism

**Statement:** Same seed must produce byte-identical stdout across runs.

**Verification:** Run same configuration twice with same seed; diff stdout. Wall-clock timing goes to stderr (not stdout).

**Common violation sources:**
- Go map iteration feeding output ordering (R2)
- Floating-point accumulation order dependencies
- Wall-clock-dependent randomness (must use PartitionedRNG)
- Stateful scorers with non-deterministic internal state

---

## INV-7: Signal Freshness Hierarchy

**Statement:** Routing snapshot signals have tiered freshness due to DES event ordering and configurable staleness.

| Signal | Owner | Freshness (interval=0) | Freshness (interval>0) | Updated By |
|--------|-------|------------------------|------------------------|------------|
| InFlightRequests | Cluster | Synchronous | Synchronous | `RoutingDecisionEvent.Execute()` (increment), completion detection (decrement) |
| QueueDepth | Instance | Immediate | Periodic | `QueuedEvent.Execute()` |
| BatchSize | Instance | Immediate | Periodic | `StepEvent.Execute()` |
| KVUtilization | Instance | Immediate | Periodic | `FormBatch()` → `AllocateKVBlocks()` |
| CacheHitRate | Instance | Immediate | Periodic | `FormBatch()` |

**Design implication:** When `--snapshot-refresh-interval > 0`, all Prometheus-sourced signals (QueueDepth, BatchSize, KVUtilization) share the same scrape interval — matching real vLLM deployments where all three are exposed via the same `/metrics` endpoint. `InFlightRequests` remains synchronous (gateway-local counter, not Prometheus-sourced).

`EffectiveLoad()` = `QueueDepth + BatchSize + InFlightRequests`. The synchronous `InFlightRequests` term compensates for Periodic staleness in the other two terms.

**Verification:** H3 hypothesis experiment (`hypotheses/h3-signal-freshness/`), H29 (`hypotheses/h29-snapshot-staleness/`).

**Evidence:** Issues #282, #283. At rate=5000, kv-utilization-only routing produces 200x worse distribution uniformity than queue-depth. Issue #463: unified Prometheus staleness model.

---

## INV-8: Work-Conserving Property

**Statement:** After every step completion, if `WaitQ.Len() > 0`, a `StepEvent` must exist in the event queue. The simulator must not idle while there is work waiting.

**Verification:** `sim/simulator_test.go` — `TestWorkConserving_StepRestartsWhenWaitQNonEmpty`. Deterministic test with `MaxRunningReqs=1`, two requests arriving simultaneously. Without the property, the second request is stranded forever (no arrival to trigger a new StepEvent). With the property, both complete.

**Evidence:** H-MMK experiment (PR #325) — without the work-conserving fix, W_q error was 151,000% at ρ=0.3. After fix, error dropped to 47% (remaining gap is discrete step processing, not a bug).

**Additional evidence (hardening wave):** Issue #349, fix #519 — Go `range` over mutable `RunningBatch.Requests` during `FormBatch` Phase 1 visited evicted requests, triggering 102K+ cascading preemptions with zero completions. The simulator never made forward progress (zero completed requests = INV-8 violation). See R21.

**Code location:** Search for `// Work-conserving:` comment in `sim/simulator.go` — the `else` branch of `len(remaining) > 0` checks `WaitQ.Len() > 0` and schedules a new `StepEvent`.

**Hypothesis family:** Structural model (same as INV-4, INV-7).

## INV-9: Oracle Knowledge Boundary

**Statement:** Servability decisions — enqueue guard (`EnqueueRequest`), admission control (`AdmissionPolicy`), routing (`RoutingPolicy`), and priority scoring (`PriorityPolicy`) — must not read `Request.OutputTokens` or `len(Request.OutputTokens)`. The control plane uses `Request.MaxOutputLen` (client-declared output budget) for sequence-length checks against `MaxModelLen`. When `MaxOutputLen == 0` (no client budget) and `maxModelLen > 0`, `EnqueueRequest` auto-fills `MaxOutputLen = maxModelLen - len(InputTokens)` before guards run, mirroring vLLM's `input_processor.py:554`. The runtime stop in `processCompletions` provides defense-in-depth. Only the execution engine (`executeBatchStep`, `processCompletions`, `recordRequestCompletion`, `FormBatch` step planning) may access `OutputTokens` for token generation, completion detection, and per-step resource allocation.

**Rationale:** In real inference serving (vLLM), the engine does not know actual output length at admission time — only the client's declared `max_tokens` budget. BLIS's `Request.OutputTokens` is oracle knowledge (pre-determined for simulation). Using it for servability decisions would make the simulator's control plane behave differently from a real system, invalidating capacity planning results. See issue #567 ("Architectural Principle: Oracle Knowledge Boundary").

**Scope:** The boundary applies to *servability* decisions (admit/reject/route), not to all scheduler operations. `FormBatch` legitimately reads `OutputTokens` for decode-phase step planning (whether to allocate a decode token), which mirrors vLLM's scheduler reading sequence state for per-step execution. The distinction: "should this request enter the system?" (servability — no oracle) vs. "what should this request do in the current step?" (execution — oracle allowed).

**Verification:** `sim/simulator_test.go` — `TestEnqueueRequest_MaxOutputLen_OracleKnowledgeBoundary`: a request with `OutputTokens=1000` but `MaxOutputLen=0` and `MaxModelLen=512` is NOT rejected (auto-fill sets `MaxOutputLen=312`, budget check `200+312=512 <= 512` passes), proving the enqueue guard does not peek at `OutputTokens`. Grep-based verification: `admission.go`, `routing.go`, `routing_scorers.go`, `routing_prefix_scorer.go`, `scheduler.go`, `priority.go` contain zero references to `OutputTokens`.

**Evidence:** Issue #567 — the original implementation's BC-4 fallback (`effectiveMaxOutput = len(r.OutputTokens)`) violated this boundary. Fixed in the same PR after convergence review caught it.

**Hypothesis family:** Structural model (same as INV-4, INV-7, INV-8).

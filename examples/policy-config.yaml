# BLIS Policy Configuration (defaults)
#
# Use with: ./simulation_worker run --model <model> --policy-config policy-config.yaml
#
# All fields are optional. Omit any field to use CLI flags or built-in defaults.
# CLI flags always override YAML values when both are specified.
#
# To verify which policies are active, run with --log info.
#
# Available policies:
#   admission: always-admit (default), token-bucket, reject-all
#   routing:   round-robin (default), least-loaded, weighted, prefix-affinity, always-busiest
#   priority:  constant (default), slo-based, inverted-slo
#   scheduler: fcfs (default), priority-fcfs, sjf, reverse-priority
#
# See also: examples/weighted-routing.yaml for a weighted routing example.

  policy: always-admit
  # token_bucket_capacity: 10000      # max tokens (only for token-bucket)
  # token_bucket_refill_rate: 1000    # tokens/second (only for token-bucket)

routing:
  policy: round-robin
  # cache_weight: 0.6                 # cache affinity weight (only for weighted)
  # load_weight: 0.4                  # load balance weight (only for weighted)
  # Weights should sum to 1.0 (auto-normalized if they don't).

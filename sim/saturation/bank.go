//
// Behavior:
//   - Names are validated, de-duplicated, and re-ordered into rosterOrder, so the
//     output is independent of CLI order and of duplicate entries (INV-6).
//   - An unknown name is a hard error listing the valid names (R1) — never a
//     silent drop.
//   - An empty selection is an error: the bank must drive at least one detector.
//   - Config-block ownership is enforced over the selected SET
//     (checkBlockOwnershipSet): a tuning block whose owning detector is NOT among
//     the selected names is a hard error (R1), mirroring the single-detector
//     path — never a silent drop. `all` selects every owner, so a shared config
//     is fine; a subset that omits a detector whose block was supplied errors.
//   - Each selected detector is then built via buildDetector, which applies the
//     block that belongs to it. Value errors within a selected detector's own
//     block still surface (range/finiteness), never a panic (R6).

// CombinedReport is the on-disk shape of a saturation trace: one JSON object
// with a "final" detector→label map (#1517) followed by a "trace" array of
// per-event verdicts (#1516/#1519). It is deliberately a keyed object (not a bare
// array) so sibling keys can be added without a format break.
//
// Final is emitted before Trace and dropped by omitempty when no detector ran, so
// a report with no final labels stays {"trace":[...]} byte-identical to the
// pre-#1517 shape. Level's MarshalJSON emits the bare string ("STABLE"), so
// map[string]Level serializes as {"composite":"STABLE",...} with keys sorted by
// encoding/json — byte-identical across identical runs (INV-6).

// ReplayOneDetector streams one detector over completed request metrics and
// records its verdict after every event to the sink. It is the SINGLE-detector
// drive loop (#1516); the multi-detector Bank (#1519) has its own fanout loop but
// shares buildSortedEvents, so both consume a byte-identical event sequence.
// Every detector is a streaming detector (#1515), so there is no per-detector
// special case in either loop.
//
// Each request contributes two events — an Arrival at its arrival time and a
// Completion at arrival+E2E — ordered deterministically by
// (timestamp, event-type, request-id). The detector is Reset() first so a
// detector reused across the run/observe legs starts from a clean state.
//
// Input adapters (run/replay from the sim, observe from the real server) all
// feed this same loop; the only difference is the []sim.RequestMetrics source.
// Zero requests produce zero events and thus an empty (but valid) trace.

// (multi-detector, #1519) so both fan out over a byte-identical event sequence —
// the guarantee that a subset detector's records match its records under `all`
// (INV-6) and that run/replay parity holds (INV-13). Zero requests yield zero
// events.
//
// Arrival (0) sorts before Completion (1) at an equal timestamp; request-id
// breaks any remaining tie. sort.Slice is not stable, but the three-key

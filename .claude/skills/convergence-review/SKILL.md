description: Dispatch parallel review perspectives and enforce convergence via persistent state file and automatic Phase A/B loop. Supports 8 gate types — design doc (8), macro plan (8), PR plan (10), PR code (10), pr-docs (7), hypothesis design (5), hypothesis code (5), hypothesis FINDINGS (10). Automatically loops through Phase A (review/tally) and Phase B (fix/verify) until 0 CRITICAL + 0 IMPORTANT or round limit.

# Convergence Review Dispatcher

Dispatch parallel review perspectives for gate **$0** and enforce convergence via a two-phase state machine with persistent state.

## Model Selection

The skill accepts an optional `--model` flag that selects the review model. Valid values: `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`. Default: **`haiku`**. Invalid values are rejected with an error message.

```
/convergence-review pr-code                    # uses haiku (default)
/convergence-review pr-plan plan.md --model sonnet
/convergence-review h-findings FINDINGS.md --model opus
```

`REVIEW_MODEL` stores the short name. The Agent tool resolves these to the appropriate model version (e.g., `opus` → `claude-opus-4-6`).

**On re-entry (resuming from a state file):** If `--model` is explicitly provided, use it and update the state file. If omitted, use the value from the state file (not the default `haiku`).

## Gate Types

| Gate | Anchor | Artifact | Triage Scope | Verification | Perspectives | Prompts Source |
|------|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| `design` | File | Design doc at `$1` | Disabled | Link check | 8 | [design-prompts.md](design-prompts.md) Section A |
| `macro-plan` | File | Macro plan at `$1` | Disabled | Link check | 8 | [design-prompts.md](design-prompts.md) Section B |
| `pr-plan` | File | Micro plan at `$1` | Disabled | Link check | 10 | [pr-prompts.md](pr-prompts.md) Section A |
| `pr-code` | Diff | `git diff HEAD` output | File-change heuristic | Build/test/lint | 10 | [pr-prompts.md](pr-prompts.md) Section B |
| `pr-docs` | Diff | `git diff HEAD` output | File-change heuristic | Link check | 7 | [pr-prompts.md](pr-prompts.md) Section C |
| `h-design` | Context | Conversation context | Disabled | None | 5 | `.claude/skills/hypothesis-experiment/review-prompts.md` Section A |
| `h-code` | File | `run.sh` + `analyze.py` at `$1` | Change-recommending | Build/test/lint | 5 | `.claude/skills/hypothesis-experiment/review-prompts.md` Section B |
| `h-findings` | File | FINDINGS.md at `$1` | Change-recommending | Link check | 10 | `.claude/skills/hypothesis-experiment/review-prompts.md` Section C |

When a new gate type is added, it MUST be added to this table with all 7 columns declared. When new perspective prompts are added for any gate, they MUST use the standard citation-requirement footer (see any existing prompt in `pr-prompts.md`, `design-prompts.md`, or `review-prompts.md` for the exact format).

**Anchor categories:**
- **File-anchored:** Artifact is a file path. State keyed by `<gate>-<basename-without-extension>`. Commit anchor: `git rev-parse HEAD` (full SHA).
- **Diff-anchored:** Artifact is `git diff HEAD`. State keyed by `<gate>-<branch-name>`. Commit anchor: `git rev-parse HEAD` (full SHA).
- **Context-anchored:** Artifact is conversation context. State keyed by `<gate>-<branch-name>`. No commit anchor (null). Staleness based on `updated_at` timestamp (24-hour warning).

**Triage scope categories:**
- **Disabled:** All findings are in-scope. Document and context reviews naturally reference files across the codebase.
- **File-change heuristic:** If a finding references a file not in `git diff HEAD`, flag it as potentially out-of-scope. Note: `git diff HEAD` includes staged and unstaged changes but not untracked files — stage new files before invoking.
- **Change-recommending:** If a finding recommends *changing* a file outside the experiment directory, flag it. Mere *references* are not flagged. Examples: "sim/kv/cache.go should add a nil check" → flagged. "sim/kv/cache.go exhibits O(n²) behavior" → not flagged.

**Verification categories:**
- **Build/test/lint:** Run the project's CI verification (`go build ./...`, `go test ./... -count=1`, `golangci-lint run ./...`).
- **Link check:** Verify referenced files exist, check for broken internal links.
- **None:** No verification gate (context-based gates with no file artifact).

## State File

**Location:** `.claude/convergence-state/<gate>-<artifact-id>.json`

The state file persists convergence state across the Phase A/B loop and across session boundaries. It tracks the current round, model, findings history, and convergence status.

The artifact ID is derived from the gate's anchor category (see gate table). Behavioral requirement: no collisions across concurrent gates, human-readable names.

**Artifact ID collision between workflow steps:** The PR workflow invokes `pr-code` at both Step 2.5 and Step 4.5 on the same branch. The commit anchor disambiguates: code is committed between steps, so the stale-commit check resets the state. **Users must commit between successive convergence passes on the same branch.** If Step 4.5 is invoked before committing, stale state from Step 2.5 (possibly `converged`) would cause premature exit.

**Schema (producer/consumer contract — Phase A MUST write these fields, Phase B MUST read from them):**

```json
{
  "gate": "pr-code",
  "artifact_id": "pr-code-pr19-routing",
  "commit": "a529ff4e3b1c2d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e",
  "schema_version": 1,
  "round": 2,
  "max_rounds": 10,
  "model": "haiku",
  "history": [
    {
      "round": 1,
      "critical": 2,
      "important": 5,
      "suggestion": 3,
      "in_scope": {"critical": 2, "important": 3},
      "findings": [
        {"perspective": "PC-1", "severity": "CRITICAL", "location": "sim/kv/cache.go:142", "disposition": "fix", "description": "Missing zero-guard on denominator"},
        {"perspective": "PC-3", "severity": "IMPORTANT", "location": "sim/config.go:88", "disposition": "filed", "issue": "#692", "description": "Exported mutable map"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "status": "not-converged",
  "updated_at": "2026-03-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Findings array fields (required per finding):**

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `perspective` | string | Perspective ID (e.g., "PC-1", "PP-3", "DD-2", "PD-1") |
| `severity` | string | One of: `CRITICAL`, `IMPORTANT`, `SUGGESTION` |
| `location` | string | File:line reference, section heading, or "unknown" if not parseable |
| `description` | string | What is wrong (specific, not vague) |
| `disposition` | string | One of: `fix` (in-scope, to be fixed), `filed` (GitHub issue created), `downgraded` (demoted to SUGGESTION), `resolved` (confirmed fixed in Phase B). Initial value at Phase A extraction is always `fix`; transitions to other values happen in triage (step 6) or Phase B. |
| `issue` | string (optional) | GitHub issue number (e.g., `"#692"`). Present only when `disposition == "filed"`. |

**Status values:** `reviewing` (Phase A in progress), `not-converged` (entering Phase B), `converged` (done), `stalled` (round > max_rounds).

**Schema version handling:** If `schema_version` is higher than the skill's supported version, treat as corrupted — delete and start fresh at round 1.

**Lifecycle:**
1. **Created** on first invocation (round 1, status `reviewing`).
2. **Updated** after each Phase A tally (history appended, status set).
3. **Deleted** on convergence (after suggestion cleanup) — no stale state.
4. **Deleted** on stall if user chooses abort. Reset round counter if user chooses continue.

**Commit anchoring** follows the anchor category from the gate table:
- **File/diff-anchored gates:** Record `git rev-parse HEAD` (full SHA). On re-entry, if stored commit differs from current HEAD → stale. Reset to round 1 with log message. (Commit amend also changes HEAD and triggers reset — conservative but correct.)
- **Context-anchored gates:** Record no commit (`null`). If `updated_at` is older than 24 hours, emit staleness warning and ask user: continue or reset.

**Error handling:** If a state file exists but fails to parse (corrupted JSON, missing required fields, `schema_version` higher than supported), treat as "no file exists" — log a warning, delete the file, start fresh at round 1.

**Gitignore:** `.claude/convergence-state/` is gitignored (session-local state, not committed).

## Convergence Protocol (non-negotiable)

> **Canonical source:** [docs/contributing/convergence.md](../../../docs/contributing/convergence.md). The rules below are a self-contained copy for skill execution; convergence.md is authoritative if they diverge.

These rules are identical across all gates. No exceptions. No shortcuts.

### Hard Rules

1. **Zero means zero.** One CRITICAL from one reviewer = not converged.
2. **Re-run is mandatory.** After fixing issues, Phase B always re-enters Phase A. The state machine enforces this — no manual re-invocation needed.
3. **SUGGESTION items do not block.** Only CRITICAL and IMPORTANT count for convergence. Suggestions are fixed but don't trigger re-runs.
4. **Independent tallying.** Read each agent's output. Count findings yourself. Agents have fabricated "0 CRITICAL, 0 IMPORTANT" when actual output contained 3 CRITICAL + 18 IMPORTANT (#390). **Never use agent-reported totals.**
5. **No partial re-runs.** Re-run ALL perspectives, not just the ones that found issues. Fixes can introduce new issues in other perspectives.
6. **Agent timeout = 5 minutes.** If an agent exceeds this, check its output and restart. If it fails, perform that review directly.
7. **Max 10 rounds per gate.** If still not converged, stall and ask user.

### Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Blocks? |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| **CRITICAL** | Must fix. Missing control experiment, status contradicted by data, silent data loss, cross-document contradiction. | Yes |
| **IMPORTANT** | Should fix. Fixing would change a conclusion, metric, or user guidance. | Yes |
| **SUGGESTION** | Cosmetic. Off-by-one line citation, style consistency, terminology nit. | No |

**When in doubt:** If fixing it would change any conclusion → IMPORTANT. If only readability → SUGGESTION.

### Behavioral Invariants

The skill MUST maintain these properties (SK-INV = skill invariant, separate from DES invariants INV-1 through INV-13):

- **SK-INV-1 Loop integrity:** The skill MUST never exit with status `not-converged`. The only exits are `converged` (0/0 in-scope), `stalled` (round > 10), or unresolvable verification failure (user decision).
- **SK-INV-2 Round monotonicity:** The round counter MUST never decrease within a single state file lifetime (stale-commit reset creates a new state file).
- **SK-INV-3 Tally independence:** The skill MUST count findings from agent output independently. It MUST never use agent-reported totals as the convergence input.
- **SK-INV-4 State-status consistency (applies to Phase A tally results only — Phase B intermediate state is exempt):** If Phase A's tallied `in_scope.critical + in_scope.important > 0`, status MUST be `not-converged` or `stalled`. If both are 0, status MUST be `converged`. Phase B step 5 always writes `not-converged` because fixes have not yet been verified by a new Phase A round — this is not an SK-INV-4 violation. If the Phase A consistency check detects a mismatch, the count-derived status takes precedence and a **visible warning** is emitted (e.g., "SK-INV-4 mismatch: counts show 2 IMPORTANT but status was converged — correcting to not-converged").
- **SK-INV-5 Stale invalidation:** If the stored commit differs from current HEAD (for file/diff-anchored gates), the state MUST be reset to round 1.
- **SK-INV-6 Findings persistence:** Every Phase A tally that writes a history entry (step 8) MUST include a `findings` array with all extracted findings. Phase B MUST read its fix list exclusively from the state file's findings array, never from conversation context. A session crash after Phase A step 8 (state file write) MUST NOT lose any finding data. A crash during steps 4-7 (before step 8) results in an incomplete round — the `reviewing` status triggers re-dispatch on resume. Note: if a crash occurs after step 6 (triage) but before step 8, any GitHub issues filed during triage already exist; on re-dispatch, check for existing issues before filing to avoid duplicates.

---

## Phase A — Review and Tally

**Entry conditions and pre-dispatch checks (checked in order):**

1. **Parse args:** Strip `--model <value>` if present, validate. Remaining tokens → gate type and artifact path.

2. **Load or create state:**
   - **No file exists (or corrupted/unsupported version):** Create new state (round 1, status `reviewing`). Proceed to dispatch.
   - **File exists, commit matches HEAD (or context-anchored gate), status `not-converged`:** For context-anchored gates, first check `updated_at` — if older than 24 hours, emit staleness warning and ask user: continue or reset. Otherwise, increment round (immediately persist), set status to `reviewing`, and proceed to dispatch. Setting status to `reviewing` before dispatch ensures that a crash between this step and step 8 is correctly classified as an interrupted mid-Phase-A replay on resume.
   - **File exists, commit matches HEAD (or context-anchored gate), status `reviewing`:** For context-anchored gates, first check `updated_at` — if older than 24 hours, emit staleness warning and ask user: continue or reset. Otherwise, resume Phase A from dispatch WITHOUT incrementing round (interrupted mid-Phase-A replay). The history entry for this round has not yet been written; re-dispatch gets fresh perspective results. Proceed to dispatch.
   - **File exists, commit differs from HEAD (file/diff-anchored gates):** Stale. Log: `"State from commit <old> invalidated by HEAD <new>. Starting Round 1."` Delete old file, create fresh state. Proceed to dispatch.
   - **File exists, status `converged`:** Emit `"Gate <gate> already converged in Round N. Nothing to do."` Exit. (24-hour staleness does not apply to terminal states — converged means done.)
   - **File exists, status `stalled`:** Emit `"Gate <gate> stalled after N rounds."` Ask user: abort (delete state, exit) or reset (reset round counter, proceed).

2a. **Fix verification (Round 2+ only).** If this is Round 2 or later and the previous round has a history entry:
   - Load the previous round's `findings` array. If the array is missing or null (pre-#668 state file), skip fix verification with a warning.
   - For each finding with `disposition == "fix"`:
     - Extract the file path from `location` (if parseable as a file path).
     - If `location` is not a parseable file path (e.g., `"unknown"`, a section heading, or a context reference): skip file-based verification for this finding with a note: `"Skipping file verification for <perspective> finding — no file path in location."`
     - If `location` is a file path: check if the file appears dirty in `git status`. If the file is NOT dirty and the finding was not explicitly marked `resolved`: emit a warning: `"WARNING: Round N finding not yet addressed: <perspective> <severity>: <description truncated to 80 chars>"`
   - Findings with `disposition` of `filed`, `downgraded`, or `resolved` are skipped (BC-6).
   - **This is a soft gate:** warnings are emitted but dispatch proceeds regardless. The next Phase A round is the real verification — this substep catches obvious oversights early.
   - **Note:** The `location` field records where the problem was found, not necessarily which file was edited to fix it. A finding citing `sim/config.go:88` might be fixed by editing `sim/kv/cache.go`. This heuristic catches the common case; the full re-review catches the rest.

3. **Assemble and dispatch a single foreground agent** with all N perspective prompts and the artifact. Model from state file.

   **Why single agent:** Background task IDs are session-local and can become invalid mid-session (producing "No task found with ID" errors). A single foreground call is reliable and sends the artifact once instead of N times (lower token cost for large diffs/files).

   - **Exception:** The structural validation perspective in PR plan reviews (PP-5) is performed directly by the skill — not delegated. For `pr-plan` and `pr-docs` gates, the agent receives a reduced set of prompts — `pr-plan` omits PP-5 (agent receives PP-1–PP-4, PP-6–PP-10); `pr-docs` omits PD-5 (agent receives PD-1–PD-4, PD-6–PD-7). Direct evaluation findings for PP-5 and PD-5 are added to the findings array in step 4 alongside sections parsed from the agent's output. For all other gates, the agent receives all N prompts.

   - **Empty-diff precondition (diff-anchored gates only):** If `git diff HEAD` produces no output, emit warning ("No changes detected since last commit — nothing to review") and skip dispatch. Stage new files or commit before invoking.

   - **Prompt assembly:** Build a single prompt in this order:
     1. Opening instruction:
        ```
        You are performing a multi-perspective review. Each section below is an independent review perspective. Complete each section fully before moving to the next. Do not let earlier sections influence later ones — treat each as if starting fresh.
        ```
     2. Artifact block (once):
        ```
        ## ARTIFACT

        <artifact content — diff, file contents, or context per gate type>
        ```
        Context payload per gate type:
        - File-anchored gates (`design`, `macro-plan`, `pr-plan`, `h-code`, `h-findings`): paste the file contents of `$1`.
        - Diff-anchored gates (`pr-code`, `pr-docs`): paste `git diff HEAD` output.
        - Context-anchored gates (`h-design`): paste the hypothesis sentence, classification, and experiment design from the current conversation context.
     3. Perspective sections (one per prompt, in ID order):
        ```
        ## [<ID>] <Perspective Name>

        <full prompt text for this perspective>
        ```

   - **Invoke:** Call the Agent tool with `run_in_background=False` (foreground), the assembled prompt, and `model=REVIEW_MODEL` where `REVIEW_MODEL` defaults to `"haiku"` when `--model` is not specified (see Model Selection section). Pass the model value explicitly — never omit it — so the Agent tool never inherits the session's active model (which may be `opus`).

   - **Missing section handling:** After the agent completes, collect all `## [<ID>]` headers that appear in the output. For each expected perspective ID that is absent, emit `"WARNING: No section found for <ID> in agent output — recording 0 findings for this perspective"` and proceed. Do NOT treat a missing section as convergence-clean evidence.

4. **Collect, extract, and tally independently.** Parse the single agent's output by section header:
   a. Split the output on `## [<ID>]` headers (lines matching `^## \[`) to isolate each perspective's section. For each section, extract individual findings. For each finding, record: `perspective` (the ID from the section header, e.g., "PP-1"), `severity`, `location` (file:line or best available reference), `description`. For `pr-plan` gates, also include findings from the direct PP-5 evaluation in this same array. For `pr-docs` gates, also include findings from the direct PD-5 evaluation in this same array.
   b. If a finding lacks a parseable location, set `location` to `"unknown"` and emit a warning: `"Finding from <perspective> has no location — recorded as 'unknown'."` (BC-7)
   c. Set initial `disposition` to `"fix"` for all findings. (Triage in step 6 may update some to `"filed"`.)
   d. Count CRITICAL and IMPORTANT yourself. **Never trust agent-reported totals** (per #390).
   e. Build the round's `findings` array in memory from all extracted findings across all perspectives. This array is NOT yet written to disk — it is persisted atomically in step 8 after triage (step 6) may have updated dispositions.
   f. If a perspective agent produces no parseable findings, record zero findings for that perspective (not an error).

5. **State file consistency check:** Before recording results, verify in-scope counts match the intended status. If inconsistent, count-derived status takes precedence and a **visible warning** is emitted (SK-INV-4).

6. **Triage.** All findings default to **Fix** (in-scope). Phase B proceeds automatically.
   - **Out-of-scope detection** follows the gate table's "Triage Scope" column.
   - When out-of-scope findings are flagged, present as a **single batch prompt**:
     ```
     N findings reference files outside the current scope:
     1. [IMPORTANT] PC-3: tiered.go — pre-existing race condition
     2. [IMPORTANT] PC-9: config.go — exported mutable map
     Enter numbers to file as issues (e.g., "1,2"), or "all" to file all, or press enter to fix all in-scope:
     ```
   - CRITICAL items get warning: `"(CRITICAL — presumed in-scope; file only if certain this is pre-existing)"`
   - **If user response cannot be parsed, default to File-all** for flagged items and emit a warning. (File-all is safer than Fix-all for out-of-scope items — it tracks without applying potentially risky fixes to unrelated code.)
   - Items marked **File:** filed as GitHub issues immediately (following `docs/contributing/pr-workflow.md` conventions), recorded in state history with disposition `filed` and issue number, excluded from convergence check.

7. **Convergence check:** `in_scope.critical == 0 AND in_scope.important == 0`.

8. **Update state file:** Append round entry to history — including the complete `findings` array built in step 4 — set status, write `updated_at`. For file/diff-anchored gates, record full SHA (`git rev-parse HEAD`). The findings array MUST be persisted before proceeding to step 9 (BC-1).

9. **Emit status banner** (exact formatting is illustrative — implementation owns the rendering).

10. **Branch:**
    - **Converged:** Fix suggestions if any (see Suggestion Cleanup below), run verification, delete state file, exit.
    - **Stalled:** Keep state file, present round-over-round trend, ask user: abort or reset.
    - **Not converged:** Enter Phase B immediately. No exit, no pause, no re-invocation needed.

---

## Phase B — Fix and Rerun

Phase B is entered automatically from Phase A when in-scope CRITICAL or IMPORTANT findings exist. **No manual re-invocation needed.**

1. **Read findings from the state file.** Load the most recent history entry's `findings` array. If the array is missing or null (pre-#668 state file), treat as empty and emit a warning (BC-8). Filter to findings with `disposition == "fix"`. Group by severity (CRITICAL first, then IMPORTANT, then SUGGESTION). This is the authoritative fix list — do not rely on conversation context for what to fix (BC-2, BC-5).

2. **Fix all items in priority order** using confidence-tiered autonomy:
   - **CRITICAL fixes (process first):** For each CRITICAL finding, emit the proposed changes as output text, then **stop and wait for the user's next message** before applying. The user may: (a) approve — apply the fix, (b) provide an alternative fix — apply the user's version, (c) file as issue — record with disposition `filed` and exclude from convergence, (d) downgrade to SUGGESTION — it will be fixed in the suggestion pass below. **After the user responds, continue to the next CRITICAL item.** The state file's `not-converged` status ensures the loop resumes even if the session is interrupted during a CRITICAL fix pause. Note: a finding downgraded via option (d) is treated as a SUGGESTION and fixed in the SUGGESTION pass without additional approval.
   - **IMPORTANT fixes (process next):** Auto-fix without pause. The next Phase A round catches any semantic regressions.
   - **SUGGESTION fixes (process last):** Auto-fix without pause.

3. **Stage any new files** created by fixes so they are visible to the next Phase A round's diff.

4. **Run verification gate** per the gate table's "Verification" column:
   - **Build/test/lint:** Run the project's CI verification. If any fail, fix before proceeding.
   - **Link check:** Verify referenced files exist, check for broken internal links.
   - **None:** No verification gate.

5. **Update state file:** **Mutate in-place** the current round's history entry (do NOT append a new entry — Phase B updates the same round's entry that Phase A created). For each finding that was fixed, update its `disposition` from `"fix"` to `"resolved"`. For findings downgraded by the user during CRITICAL review, update `disposition` to `"downgraded"`. Persist the state file with status `not-converged`.

6. **Emit transition banner:**
   ```
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
     ROUND N FIXES COMPLETE — M items resolved
     Re-entering Phase A for Round N+1...
   ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
   ```

7. **Re-enter Phase A immediately.** No pause, no user prompt, no manual re-invocation. This is the structural enforcement that prevents the loop from breaking.

**No git commit in Phase B.** Fixes accumulate as working tree changes. The PR workflow's Step 5 handles the single commit. The state file's `history` array is the audit trail.

**Multi-session caveat:** If the session ends mid-convergence, the working tree preserves fixes on disk and the state file records history. On session resumption, the skill re-reads the state file and continues from the last recorded status. The next Phase A round catches any incomplete fixes. Note: for `pr-code` (diff-anchored), the diff reviewed in the resumed round will include both the original changes and any Phase B fixes applied in prior sessions — this is the correct and intended behavior (reviewers should see the full current state of the PR).

**Only exits from the loop:**
- Phase A: `converged` (0/0 in-scope)
- Phase A: `stalled` (round > 10)
- Phase B: verification gate failure that can't be resolved (ask user)
- Suggestion Cleanup: user chooses to fix a verification failure after suggestion cleanup (fix is not re-reviewed — acceptable since the user explicitly approved it)

---

## Suggestion Cleanup on Convergence

When Phase A tallies 0 CRITICAL, 0 IMPORTANT, but N > 0 SUGGESTION:

1. Emit the CONVERGED banner.
2. List suggestion items.
3. Fix all suggestions.
4. Run verification gate (per gate table). If verification fails after a suggestion fix, present the user with two options:
   - **Revert the suggestion fix and exit clean:** The PR is convergence-verified, the suggestion is simply dropped. State file deleted. Exit.
   - **Fix the verification issue and continue:** Apply the verification fix, then proceed to step 5. **Warning: this verification fix is not re-reviewed by any perspective. It is accepted on user approval only.** Choose this option only if the verification fix is trivial (e.g., undo a rename that broke a reference).
5. Delete state file.
6. Exit skill.

No re-run triggered. Suggestions are cosmetic by definition.

---

## Integration with Other Skills

**The skill loops automatically — no manual re-invocation needed between rounds.** Phase B re-enters Phase A without any user action. The loop only exits when 0 CRITICAL + 0 IMPORTANT (converged), round > 10 (stalled), or an unresolvable verification failure.
